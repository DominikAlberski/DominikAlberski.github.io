I"¼<p>DDD article about differences between domain and application service objects</p>
<ul>
  <li>Domain services carry domain knowledge; applicationÂ services donâ€™t (ideally).</li>
  <li>Domain services hold domain logic that doesnâ€™t naturally fit entities and value objects.</li>
  <li>Introduce domain services when you see that some logic cannot be attributed to an entity/value object because that would break their isolation.</li>
</ul>
