I"ý<p>â€‹It was an extensive, full-time, coding Bootcamp. Before starting it I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and RUBY. I thought I came well prepared, but my knowledge was enough only for the first two days, after which new concepts started and my knowledge ended.
Overall the whole curse took 240 hours of classes about: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, OOP, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, Testing</p>

<p>The knowledge that I gained there allowed me to obtain my first employment as a Junior Ruby Programmer.</p>
