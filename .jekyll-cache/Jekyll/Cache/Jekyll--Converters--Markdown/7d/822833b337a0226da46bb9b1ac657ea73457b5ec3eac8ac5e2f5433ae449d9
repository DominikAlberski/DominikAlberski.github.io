<p>Iâ€™ve learn a lot here. I was working in a small team and have my first hands on experience with git flow.</p>

<p>It was also the first time for me to get part in agile project management process similar to scrum.</p>

<p>My main responsibility was maintenance and development of new features for <a href="https://www.llinformatics.com/case_studies/stillpoint">Stillpoint</a></p>

<p>I was using Rails 4, PostgreSQL, RSpec, and other Rails related technologies.</p>
