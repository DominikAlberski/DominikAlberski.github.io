I"×<p>This is a direct continuation of the previous contract, for the same company and management but a different branch/brand.</p>

<p>My duties regarding coding havenâ€™t changed much from the previous ones but as an additional task, I also started to review my teammateâ€™s Pull Requests.</p>

<p>Also due to my initiative, and nagging we were trying to introduce some sort of annual knowledge exchange thru presentations of what we have learned in the last period.</p>
