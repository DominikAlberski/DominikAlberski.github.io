The former name of my University during my time of studies was High School of Finance and Management in Warsaw. The field of my study was Social Psychology. I had good academic results and was allegeable for a scholarship throughout the study period.

In my 4th year, I started working as a computer technician. After graduation, I started volunteering as a laboratory assistant. One of my responsibilities was writing simple programs for laboratory equipment for rats behavioral experiments.
