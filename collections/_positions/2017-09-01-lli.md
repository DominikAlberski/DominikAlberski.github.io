My first commercial programming experience.

I've learn a lot here. I was working as a team member and have my first hands on expirience with git flow.

It was also the first time for me te get part in agile project managment process simillar to scrum.

My main responsiblity was maintenance and development of new features for [Stillpoint](https://www.llinformatics.com/case_studies/stillpoint)

I was using Rails 4, PostgreSQL, RSpec, and other Rails related tools.
