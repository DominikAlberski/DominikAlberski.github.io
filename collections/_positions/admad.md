This is a direct continuation of the previous contract, for the same company and management but a different branch/brand.

My duties regarding coding haven't changed much from the previous ones but as an additional task, I also started to review my teammate's Pull Requests.

Also due to my initiative, and nagging we were trying to introduce some sort of annual knowledge exchange thru presentations of what we have learned in the last period.
