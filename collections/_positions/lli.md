My first commercial programming experience.

I've learn a lot here. I was working in a small team and have my first hands on experience with git flow.

It was also the first time for me to get part in agile project management process similar to scrum.

My main responsibility was maintenance and development of new features for [Stillpoint](https://www.llinformatics.com/case_studies/stillpoint)

I was using Rails 4, PostgreSQL, RSpec, and other Rails related technologies.
