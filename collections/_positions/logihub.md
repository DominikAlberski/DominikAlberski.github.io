I was part of a small development team. We were expanding and maintaining CRM-like system for in-company use. My responsibilities were focused on the backend part of the application. I was responsible for the creation of new features and maintenance of the existing code base, occasionally there were also simple front-end tasks. The application was used by various company departments and required different features and integrations with systems from other collaborating companies and clients.

During my time there, I broadened my knowledge of APIs and system integrations. I was also introduced to the Kanban-based approach to project management.

Leading technologies which I was using were Rails 5 and 6, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Sidekiq, and RabitMQ.
