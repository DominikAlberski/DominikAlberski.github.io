I was responsible for, maintaining and development of new features for one of the company clients. My work was focused mainly on backend api project that would communicate with frontend application.

During my work I was able to introduce new and improve existing practices for writing code and tests, we managed to improve cleanliness and test coverage of the codebase by significant percentage.

I worked with technologies and gems like Rails 4.2, Rails 7, grape, swagger, sidekiq, maria-db, minitest and RSpec.
