As a senior developer with a strong background in back-end development, I was primarily responsible for API integrations with third-party external services. My ability to quickly integrate with other companies' systems enabled the client to gain recognition and establish new business relationships.
In addition to integrations, I was responsible for developing new features and maintaining existing ones. I worked within a team of three developers, ranging in seniority from junior to tech lead. I conducted code reviews and provided support and guidance to other team members.
The technologies and tools I worked with included Rails (5.2 and 6.0), Grape, Swagger, Sidekiq, PostgreSQL, Minitest, RSpec, Vue.js, Stimulus, and others.
