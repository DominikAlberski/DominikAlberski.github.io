      <p>
        I'm a developer with over 4 years of commercial experience.
        Technologies that I'm using in day to day job circle around Ruby and Rails ecosystem.
        I'm familiar with SQL bases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Redis, sidekick and other tools used in Rails applications.
        My focus is mainly on Backend but in my free time, I familiarize myself with Frontend (mainly Vue framework caught my interest of late).

        After finishing my studies and securing a master degree in Social Psychology, I still didn't have a clear idea about my future.
        At that time I was working as an IT technical assistant and at the same time, I was a volunteer in BioPsychology Laboratory.
        When bough of those jobs finished suddenly I needed to find a way to support my growing family.
        I turned my eyes to the study-related field of HR and recruiting, which seemed to be a good opportunity for further career development.
        After about a year of work, I knew it wasn't for me and so I needed to find something that would match my personality better.
        It was then that I started to look into Programming.
        After long research, I decided to take part in the Programming boot-camp organized by Coder's Lab.
        With great effort (lot's of hours of learning squeezed in with a part-time job) and with support from my family I managed to finish it,
        and find my first job as a Junior programmer in <a href="https://www.llinformatics.com/">LLI</a> which jump-start my carrier and helped me get my first real experience.

    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a
      billion people, and probably more.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
            Michael is the creator of the
            <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the

            Michael is also notorious as the founder of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and
            author of <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
            Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are
            slightly exaggerated.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
            Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true
            nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code
            from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
